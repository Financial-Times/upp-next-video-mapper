# Next Video Mapper
Next Video Mapper is responsible for listening for new video events, then transforming it to a structure amenable to processing by UPP and putting this structure back on the queue.

We currently support videos created and published in Next Video Editor, that get into our stack through Cms-Notifier. In order to be processed by Next Video Mapper, a video content *MUST* include the header `X-Origin-Id=next-video-editor` .

Next Video Mapper is able to process messages for both publish and un-publish events.

## Installation
In order to install, execute the following steps:
```
go get -u github.com/Financial-Times/upp-next-video-mapper
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/Financial-Times/upp-next-video-mapper
go build -mod=readonly .
```

## Running Locally

```
export KAFKA_ADDRESS="localhost:2181" ## you'll have to change the address to your queue
export KAFKA_LAG_TOLERANCE=120
export Q_GROUP=upp-next-video-mapper
export Q_READ_TOPIC=NativeCmsPublicationEvents
export Q_WRITE_TOPIC=CmsPublicationEvents
export Q_AUTHORIZATION=$(etcdctl get /ft/_credentials/kafka-bridge/authorization_key) ## this is not exact, you'll have to get it from the cluster's etcd
export APP_PORT=... ## 8080 by default, only necessary when you need a custom port for running locally 
go build .
./upp-next-video-mapper
```

## Running Test

```
go test -mod=readonly -race ./...
```

## Expected behaviour 

A transformation from a native video JSON to a UPP video content. The event is triggered when a video will be published/deleted from Next Video Editor.

The mapper reads events from the NativeCmsPublicationEvents topic and sends the transformed package to the CmsPublicationEvents topic. 

### Publish event

An example of native video JSON model can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/tosan88/580a10da0b5ef3df0a89d40acfe957c7)
